Let’s dive in!\\n\\nFinetuning Overview To finetune, you start with a base model that has some, but not all, of the capabilities you need. The goal of finetuning is to get this model to perform well enough for your specific task.\\n\\nFinetuning is one way to do transfer learning, a concept first introduced by Bozinov‐ ski and Fulgosi in 1976. Transfer learning focuses on how to transfer the knowledge gained from one task to accelerate learning for a new, related task. This is conceptu‐ ally similar to how humans transfer skills: for example, knowing how to play the piano can make it easier to learn another musical instrument.\\n\\nAn early large-scale success in transfer learning was Google’s multilingual translation system (Johnson et. al, 2016). The model transferred its knowledge of Portuguese– English and English–Spanish translation to directly translate Portuguese to Spanish, even though there were no Portuguese–Spanish examples in the training data.'), Document(id='3d7121cf-05ea-4466-8f98-d2b010dcc69e', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\tejus\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\Full_Stack\\\\ML\\\\RAG_Chatbot\\\\rag_env\\\\data\\\\AI Engineering Building Applications with Foundation Models (Chip Huyen) (Z-Library).pdf', 'start_index': 123150}, page_content='On the Differences Among Training, Pre-Training, Finetuning, and Post-Training Training always involves changing model weights, but not all changes to model weights constitute training. For example, quantization, the process of reducing the precision of model weights, technically changes the model’s weight values but isn’t considered training.\\n\\nThe term training can often be used in place of pre-training, finetuning, and post- training, which refer to different training phases:\\n\\nPre-training'), Document(id='c9a61b57-ee33-4bd0-a127-f2ff57c1dc99', metadata={'start_index': 780012, 'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\tejus\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\Full_Stack\\\\ML\\\\RAG_Chatbot\\\\rag_env\\\\data\\\\AI Engineering Building Applications with Foundation Models (Chip Huyen) (Z-Library).pdf'}, page_content='To finetune a model using more than one machine, you’ll need a framework that helps you do distributed training, such as DeepSpeed, PyTorch Distributed, and ColossalAI.\\n\\nFinetuning hyperparameters\\n\\nDepending on the base model and the finetuning method, there are many hyperpara‐ meters you can tune to improve finetuning efficiency. For specific hyperparameters for your use case, check out the documentation of the base model or the finetuning framework you use. Here, I’ll cover a few important hyperparameters that frequently appear.\\n\\nLearning rate. The learning rate determines how fast the model’s parameters should change with each learning step. If you think of learning as finding a path toward a goal, the learning rate is the step size. If the step size is too small, it might take too long to get to the goal. If the step size is too big, you might overstep the goal, and, hence, the model might never converge.'), Document(id='04d73b9c-7d30-4d7f-b1a8-4fb9ecbd2f8d', metadata={'start_index': 687981, 'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\tejus\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\Full_Stack\\\\ML\\\\RAG_Chatbot\\\\rag_env\\\\data\\\\AI Engineering Building Applications with Foundation Models (Chip Huyen) (Z-Library).pdf'}, page_content='Second, finetuning requires the knowledge of how to train models. You need to eval‐ uate base models to choose one to finetune. Depending on your needs and resources, options might be limited. While finetuning frameworks and APIs can automate many steps in the actual finetuning process, you still need to understand the different training knobs you can tweak, monitor the learning process, and debug when some‐ thing is wrong. For example, you need to understand how an optimizer works, what learning rate to use, how much training data is needed, how to address overfitting/ underfitting, and how to evaluate your models throughout the process.')]\n",
